The big data era in molecular biology has created exiting potential for novel biological discoveries, but also exciting challenges for computer scientists in data management, analysis, and interpretation. Especially exciting are the possibilities in combining omics data with medical images and phenotype variables. Therefore, in the next decades there will be developed sophisticated bioinformatics and machine learning methods and framework to analyze and explore the information in the integrated data. However, the dataset sizes and complexity requires the development of novel infrastructure systems, analysis approaches, and data exploration tools targeted for such complex health datasets.

Our goal is to provide the systems, methods, and tools needed to analyze and interpret complex health datasets. Our research interests are threefold. First, build and experimentally evaluate infrastructure systems for bioinformatics and machine learning analyses. Second, apply bioinformatics, statistics, and machine learning methods for novel health data analyses. Third, build and evaluate data exploration and interpretation tools. All our research is interdisciplinary. We therefore combine experimental computer science with real problems, applications, and data obtained from our biomedical research collaborators.

We also contribute to research infrastructure development and operation, commercialization of our research, and many outreach activities. 

# Projects

We contribute to several large and small projects. 

## NOWAC and Translational Cancer Research

The [Norwegian Woman and Cancer](http://site.uit.no/nowac/) (NOWAC) biobank contains time series with questionnaire data from 170 000 women and more than 60 000 blood samples. The biobank is analyzed using several omics technologies including microarrays, RNA-seq, methylation, and mass spectrometry. The data is being analyzed by the [Systems Epidemiology](https://en.uit.no/forskning/forskningsgrupper/gruppe?p_document_id=556488) group lead by Professor [Torkjel Sandanger](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/torkjel.sandanger) at the Department of Community Medicine, University of Tromsø. Our responsibility in the project is to build a backend for standardized data analysis pipelines, machine learning based data analysis, and a system for exploration and visualization of the analysis results. We are using these as building blocks to build a platform for swift exploration of the data under different epidemiological designs.

We are also collaborating with Professors [Lill-Tove Rasmussen Busund](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/lill.tove.rasmussen.busund) and [Tom Dønnem](https://en.uit.no/ansatte/tom.donnem) from the Translational Cancer Research Group on multi-level and multi-tissue analysis and clinical use of data from NOWAC.
